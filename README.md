# TouchScreenDebouncingDemo
A short program that demonstrates the noisy character of touchscreens and how to filter it out.

This sketch requires an Arduino UNO and a Seeed TFT Touch Shield. 

On an enigma machine, a key press will move the encoding wheels first, then apply electricity to the entry rotor and the encoded letter will light up in the lamp field. The lamp will be lit for as long as the key is pressed, once the key is released, the lamp will turn off and further key presses will move the rotors again.

When simulating this with a touchscreen, it is vital to ensure that one filters out false release events so that the rotors are not moved unnecessarily.

The code below shows how the touch screen reports no touch detected while a finger is being dragged across the screen.

The phantom touch logic was added after noticing that earlier versions of the machine were changing settings by themselves. Even though the manufacturer uses a minimum pressure check in the code, I noticed it was necessary to add a maximum value to prevent those phantom clicks. The threshold was determined by printing pressure readings greater than 0.

A short drag across the screen results in this output, of particular notice is the “no touch detected” line in between the “screen touch at” lines, even though the finger was never lifted during the dragging motion. Even pressing down firmly on one spot results in the occasional “no touch detected” line. Notice the phantom touch while the screen was idle.
